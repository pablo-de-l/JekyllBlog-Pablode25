<p>The concept of non-duality has been portrayed in both sacred and secular art pieces across different times, places, and religions to bring us closer to understanding and developing this state of consciousness. This piece is greatly influenced by the contemporary art being currently produced by diverse Indo-Islamic artists that mix real and fictional narratives of east and west, seamlessly knitting together cultural and art historical references and concerns from each.</p>

<p>The design of this sculpture started by using a digital design following arabesque tessellation principles. These patterns are one of the principal forms of Islamic ornament thatâ€™s used to avoid figurative images to represent concepts and ideas. This approach allows the artist to present the viewer with a physical experience of concepts that are abstract in nature.</p>

<p>Six pieces of the design were laser cut and painted silver in one side and metallic black on the other. Then they were put together to make a cube.</p>

<p>Finally, red, blue and green LED lights were placed on the inside to complete the light sculpture.</p>

<p>Non-duality is a relevant, universal and timeless concept that  still inspires new ways of making art that bring us closer to the appreciation of this state of consciousness.</p>
