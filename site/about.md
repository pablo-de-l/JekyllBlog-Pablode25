I'm Pablo, a Mexican designer that inspires and empowers people through art and design by collaborating in multidisciplinary teams to tell stories. I'm always ready to create and develop new ideas by implementing innovative solutions to communicate with an audience.

I'm currently studying for an Experience Design and Production Bachelor of Fine Arts at the California Institute of the Arts.
