# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a Mexican designer that inspires and empowers people through art and design by collaborating in multidisciplinary teams to tell stories. I'm passionate about Themed Entertainment and Experience design as I believe that the immersive encounters facilitated by this form of expression lead to  interactions that culminate in transformation.

My work ranges from scenic design and experience design to virtual environment design, model making, lighting design, digital fabrication, graphic design, sculpture and more..
