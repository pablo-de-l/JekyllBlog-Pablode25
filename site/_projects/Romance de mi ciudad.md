description: In Morelia, at the end of the Aqueduct, the pink quarry and the beautiful fountains make up a very unique place. Within its walls, the Alley of Romance treasures love stories that for centuries have filled this place with legends and mysticism. This sound experience invites you to explore this intimate place like never before. By listening to the verses of Lucas Ortiz, you will immerse yourself in the stories that throughout the years continue inspiring the people who go through this alley.
