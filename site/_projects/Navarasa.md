Rasa (Sanskrit for ‘juice’, ‘extract of a fruit’ or ‘essence’) refers to the finest quality of an object. The term rasa  generally refers to the ‘essence’ and emotional qualities crafted into a work of art (or a performance) by the maker and to the response the contemplation or perception of the artwork evokes in the viewer.
