# Navarasa

Rasa (रस) (Sanskrit for ‘juice’, ‘extract of a fruit’ or ‘essence’) refers to the finest quality of an object. The term rasa  generally refers to the ‘essence’ and emotional qualities crafted into a work of art (or a performance) by the maker and to the response the contemplation or perception of the artwork evokes in the viewer, or sahṛdaya सह्रदय.

Rasa is said to arise when the sthayibhava, (latent sentiment) in the individual is awakened by their/her/his perception of the vibhavas (the stimuli such as the story, the stage and the actors responsible for the awakening). This implies not the production of any new emotion in the spectator, but only the awakening of latent sentiment.

Anubhavas are the deliberate manifestations of feelings on the part of the actor (in accordance with the mood at aim). They consist of the various gestures and glances etc. of the actor which are intended to develop the basic stimulus or the vibhava.

The aesthetic theory of rasa is fundamental to many forms of Indian art as it indicates pure experience, which is distinct from empirical feeling. Using this vocabulary in the creative process and being conscious about this theory allows artists to enhance the aesthetic experience and deliver emotions in a more effective way.
